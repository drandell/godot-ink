# godot-ink

An [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) integration for [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).  

The following platforms have been tested with Godot 3.2.2:  
 * Windows ðŸ—¸
 * Linux ðŸ—¸
 * WebAssembly ðŸ—¸
 * iOS ðŸ—¸

I'm pretty sure this will also run fine on MacOS and Android but haven't witnessed it yet. If you end up testing an unlisted platform, please create an issue to tell me whether everything work or not.

## How to use

When the plugin is properly loaded, you should be able to use the new ink panel to inspect your story.

The last thing you'll need to do in order to get going is to put `ink-engine-runtime.dll` at the root of your Godot project.
`ink-engine-runtime.dll` can be found in the [ink compiler](https://github.com/inkle/ink/releases).

If you want to directly compile your `.ink` files, you'll also need to download the [ink compiler](https://github.com/inkle/ink/releases) on your computer and copy/paste the path to `inklecate.exe` into your project settings (*Project -> Project Settings... -> Ink -> Inklecate Path*).

*Note: Inklecate Path is the full path to the `inklecate.exe` i.e. C:/inklecate_windows_and_linux/inklecate.exe*

---

Everything is handled in an `InkStory` node.  
If nothing is specified, the **C#** usage is the same as the **GDScript** one.

### Loading the story

First you should navigate to your `.json` or `.ink` file and import it as an `Ink story` in Godot. To do that, select the file in Godot, go to `Import`, select `Ink story` under `Import As:` and click `ReImport`.

To load your story, you can:

* Point the `InkFile` exported variable to your `.json`/`.ink` file and check the `AutoLoadStory` checkbox in the inspector.
* Point the `InkFile` exported variable to your `.json`/`.ink` file (in the inspector or via a script) and call `story.LoadStory()`.

### Running the story and making choices

Getting content from the story is done by calling the `.Continue()` method.
```GDScript
var story = get_node("Story")
while story.CanContinue:
    print(story.Continue())
    # Alternatively, text can be accessed from story.CurrentText
```

Choices are made with the `.ChooseChoiceIndex(int)` method.
```GDScript
if story.HasChoices:
    for choice in story.CurrentChoices:
        print(choice)
    ...
    story.ChooseChoiceIndex(index)
```

### Using signals

If you don't want to bother accessing `CurrentText` and `CurrentChoices`, signals are emitted when the story continues forward and when a new choice appears.

```GDScript
    ...
    story.connect("InkContinued", self, "_on_story_continued")
    story.connect("InkChoices", self, "_on_choices")

func _on_story_continued(currentText, currentTags):
    print(currentText)

func _on_choices(currentChoices):
    for choice in choices:
        print(choice)
```

In **C#**, you can use the `nameof()` on the `[Signal]` delegates.

```C#
story.Connect(nameof(InkStory.InkContinued), this, "OnStoryContinued");
story.Connect(nameof(InkStory.InkChoices), this, "OnChoices");
```

The above signals are also available through the node inspector.

### Save / Load

You get and set the json state by calling `.GetState()` and `.SetState(String)`.

```GDScript
story.SetState(story.GetState())
```

Alternatively you can save and load directly from disk (either by passing a path or a file as argument) with `.LoadStateFromDisk` and `.SaveStateOnDisk`.  
When using a path, the default behaviour is to use the `user://` folder. You can bypass this by passing a full path to the functions (e.g. `res://my_dope_save_file.json`).

```GDScript
story.SaveStateOnDisk("save.json")
story.LoadStateFromDisk("save.json")
```

```GDScript
var file = File.new()
file.open("save.json", File.WRITE)
story.SaveStateOnDisk(file)
file.close


file.open("save.json", File.READ)
story.LoadStateFromDisk(file)
file.close
```

### Tags

Tags, global tags and knot tags are accessible respectively through `.CurrentTags`, `.GlobalTags` and `.TagsForContentAtPath(String)`.

```GDScript
print(story.CurrentTags)
print(story.GlobalTags)
print(story.TagsForContentAtPath("mycoolknot"))
```

As shown above, current tags are also passed along the current text in the `InkContinued` event.

### Jumping to a Knot/Stitch

You can [jump to a particular knot or stitch](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/RunningYourInk.md#jumping-to-a-particular-scene) with `.ChoosePathString(String)`. This method will return `false` if the jump failed.

```GDScript
if story.ChoosePathString("mycoolknot.myradstitch"):
    story.Continue()
```

### Using Ink variables

Ink variables (except InkLists for now) can be get and set.

```GDScript
story.GetVariable("foo")
story.SetVariable("foo", "bar")
```

They can also be observed with signals.

```GDScript
    ...
    story.connect(story.ObserveVariable("foo"), self, "_foo_observer")

func _foo_observer(varName, varValue):
    print(varName, " = ", varValue)
```

#### Read/Visit count

You can know how many times a knot/stitch has been visited with `.VisitCountPathString(String)`.

```GDScript
print(story.VisitCountPathString("mycoolknot.myradstitch"))
```

## Troubleshooting

### There's an error or Godot crashes when I enable the plugin

If you're having trouble enabling the editor plugin, it's probably because `ink-engine-runtime.dll` isn't referenced in your project. You can solve the issue by adding this `ItemGroup` to your `.csproj` file and rebuilding the project (from the **Mono** tab).

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <Reference Include="Ink">
        <HintPath>$(ProjectDir)/ink-engine-runtime.dll</HintPath>
        <Private>False</Private>
    </Reference>
</ItemGroup>
```
